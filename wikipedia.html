            Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> 
            <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993</p>
            <p>Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Jazayeri-2007-8">URL</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Jazayeri-2007-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
            <h4>Web 2.0</h4>
